🛍️ Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
This project uses a Random Forest Regressor model to predict sales based on historical and store-level data. It is aimed at helping retailers optimize inventory and pricing strategies by forecasting future sales with high accuracy.

📌 Overview
Sales prediction is a critical task in the retail industry. Accurate forecasting enables better inventory management, pricing decisions, and overall business planning. In this project, we:

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Explore and visualize data trends

Train a Random Forest Regressor

Evaluate performance using regression metrics

Predict sales on unseen data

🧠 Machine Learning Model
We use the Random Forest Regressor, a powerful ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Why Random Forest?
Handles non-linear data efficiently

Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging

Works well with large datasets and complex features
